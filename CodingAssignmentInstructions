# Coding Assignment Instructions

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to apply for your Software Engineering position. My two projects can be found here: https://github.com/farahsharis/CodingAssignment.git
Here are a few instructions regarding the two applications I created:
### Backend Application
The Backend application (NoteApp) was written in C#. Once the application ends, the posted notes will be lost because I allocated the notes in memory, however, I created a Repository interface for flexibility should I want to add a database later.


###FrontEnd Application
For the FrontEnd Application (GithubFrontEnd) I built it using ASP.NET MVC framework, and also used AngularJS for the first time. I am predominantly a backend developer, so this was new to me. However, I watched a few tutorials, did some research, and gave it a try. 


If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
